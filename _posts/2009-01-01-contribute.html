<p><strong>Want to help make script.aculo.us better? You can!</strong></p>
<h2>Found a bug?</h2>
<p>script.aculo.us uses Lighthouse for bug tracking:<br />
<a href="http://prototype.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8887-script-aculo-us">http://prototype.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8887-script-aculo-us</a></p>
<p>(First, be sure that there isn&#8217;t a ticket already, then file a new bug!)</p>
<h2>If you found a bug</h2>
<p>When creating a bug report, be sure to include as much relevant information as possible. Post an example that shows off the problem. Preferably, alter the unit tests and show through either changed or added tests how the expected behavior is not occuring.</p>
<h2>Source code repository</h2>
<p>script.aculo.us uses Git to manage development. Check out the current development trunk with:</p>
<pre><code>
git clone git://github.com/madrobby/scriptaculous.git
</code></pre>
<p><strong style="color:red;">As script.aculo.us 1.xx is feature-frozen, this development trunk is for bugfixes only (new features will only happen for script.aculo.us 2).</strong></p>
<h2>JavaScript is not your thing?</h2>
<p>You may also contribute by writing documentation, making tutorials and general pimping of scriptaculous! :)</p>
