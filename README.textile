h2. Scriptaculous Documentation on GitHub Pages

Since the new GitHub wikis do not support inline JavaScript, script.aculo.us is moving its documentation to "GitHub Pages":http://pages.github.com/ as the old GitHub wiki is being phased out. This makes collaboration on documentation the same workflow as collaboration the script.aculo.us source code. 

h3. Contributing to the documentation

All documentation is under the @gh-pages@ branch. To edit the documentation, fork "the script.aculo.us project":http://wiki.github.com/madrobby/scriptaculous/ and edit the documentation under the @gh-pages@ branch in your fork. When you are finished editing your documentation, please send a pull request from your repository explaining the changes you wish to pull. The primary project collaborators will be notified.
